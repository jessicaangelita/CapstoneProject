This helps all team members get immediate updates about what's happening with their JIRA projects. Whether it's a new problem, a change in the project's status, or someone leaving a note, people using Discord can stay in the loop without having to keep checking JIRA. This feature makes it easier for the team to talk and work together."

This means your team only gets the important stuff when they need it, avoiding extra notifications that might be annoying. You can set it up to tell you only about the really important updates or things related to your specific projects. This way, you can pay attention to what's most important."
